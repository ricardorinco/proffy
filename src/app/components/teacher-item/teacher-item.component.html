        Take that you mutated son-of-a-bitch. My pine, why you. You space bastard, you killed a pine. Oh, I've been so worried about you ever since you ran off the other night. Are you okay? I'm sorry I have to go. Isn't he a dream boat? Hey Dad, George, hey, you on the bike. Roads? Where we're going we don't need roads. Are you sure about this storm?

        What's a rerun? Doc, you gotta help- Marty, is that you? It's uh, the other end of town, a block past Maple. Really.
        <br /><br />

        George. I don't worry. this is all wrong. I don't know what it is but when I kiss you, it's like kissing my brother. I guess that doesn't make any sense, does it? What were you doing in the middle of the street, a kid your age. Just say anything, George, say what ever's natural, the first thing that comes to your mind. Marty, will we ever see you again?
